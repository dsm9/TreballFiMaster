What a great mom! \\n\\n\\n\\nI didn\\'t actually like Loretta right away because she seemed like a bit of a know--it-all who wasn\\'t really as adventurous and as in control of herself as she wanted others to think. She could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong, but she really didn\\'t apply common sense to her own life. She was going to marry a middle-aged mama\\'s boy simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose to her life. She was more conventional than her own mom. She dressed and wore her hair like a matron at a house of detention and seemed humorless and bored, but underneath you sensed that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man. She would probably end up making an awesome mom too.\\n\\n\\n\\nI could see in the future, a house full of Loretta and Ronnie\\'s loud, screaming happy kids and Rose and Cosmo enjoying every minute of it.', {'cats': {'POSITIVE': True, 'NEGATIVE': False}})]\n"
